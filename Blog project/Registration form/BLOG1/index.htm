            <h4>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time. </h4>
            <p>By "refactoring" your code, you're only enhancing the code without tampering with its functionality. This will improve the quality and redability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code remains free from plagiarism. </p>
